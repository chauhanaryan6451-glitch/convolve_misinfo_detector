# 🛡️ Misinformation Debunker

**Misinformation Debunker** is an advanced, agentic AI system designed to verify multimodal claims (text and images). It utilizes a **Dual-Brain Architecture** combined with a **Neural Memory Engine** to detect hoaxes with high precision.

---

* **🤖 Agentic Workflow:**
  * **Retriever Agent:** Handles vector search and memory boosting.
  * **Forensic Agent:** Performs zero-shot semantic verification (distinguishes specific hoaxes from generic images).
  * **Orchestrator:** Manages the workflow and synthesizes the final verdict.
* **🧠 Neural Memory Engine:** Implements reinforcement learning. Verified facts gain "experience points," allowing the system to recognize noisy inputs.
* **👁️ Dual-Brain Retrieval:** Uses SBERT (Text) and CLIP (Vision).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Database:** Qdrant (Local Embedded)
* **AI Models:** SBERT, CLIP, Llama-3-70b (Groq)
